<h1 align = "center">Automated Class Timetable Generator</h1>

## Motivation
- In the beginning of every semester, Schools and Colleges face a common problem of generating a timetable for each class.
- But due to <b>shortage of classrooms, limited number of teachers and limited time</b>, Manually creating a timetable that is feasible for both students
  and teachers becomes a really hectic task.
- This process is repeated every time, a new semester begins. With this project, we are presenting a solution to all these problems and ease out the 
  process of timetable generation.

## Project Description
It is a java web application that contains three modules :
- <b>Download Timetable</b> : This module lets any user download time table of different classes.
- <b>Admin Login</b> : This module lets admin add new courses, new teachers, new subjects and new classrooms and 
    allow admin to edit and generate timetable for different classes after successful login.
- <b>Teacher Login</b> : This module lets teachers edit their personal details and download their weekly schedule after successful login.
