<h1 align = "center">Automated Class Timetable Generator</h1>

## Motivation
- In the beginning of every semester, Schools and Colleges face a common problem of generating a timetable for each class.
- But due to shortage of classrooms, limited number of teachers and limited time, Manually creating a timetable that is feasible for both students
  and teachers becomes a really hectic task.
- This process is repeated every time, a new semester begins. With this project, we are presenting a solution to all these problems and ease out the 
  process of timetable generation.
